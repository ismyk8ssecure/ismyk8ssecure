vulnerability_id: CVE-2019-1002101
vulnerability_description: The kubectl cp command allows copying files between containers
  and the user machine. To copy files from a container, Kubernetes creates a tar inside
  the container, copies it over the network, and kubectl unpacks it on the user's
  machine. If the tar binary in the container is malicious, it could run any code
  and output unexpected, malicious results. An attacker could use this to write files
  to any path on the user's machine when kubectl cp is called, limited only by the
  system permissions of the local user.
