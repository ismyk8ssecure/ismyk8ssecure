vulnerability_id: CVE-2019-11245
vulnerability_description: When a container runs for the first time on a node, it
  correctly respects the UID set by the container image (e.g. USER in a Dockerfile).
  However, on the second run, the container will run as UID 0 (aka root) which can
  be an undesired escalated privilege.
